This combination balances the benefits of both sparsity and adaptive span length, making it a versatile and potentially powerful attention mechanism.
Dynamically adjust the span while focusing on the most relevant parts of the sequence.*

This combination can be interesting for tasks that benefit from both reduced computational complexity and adaptive context windows.
